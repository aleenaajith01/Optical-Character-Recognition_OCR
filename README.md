# Optical-Character-Recognition_OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, images of text, or PDFs, into editable and searchable data. It extracts printed or handwritten text from images and translates it into machine-readable characters, enabling digital editing, searching, and indexing of the content.
